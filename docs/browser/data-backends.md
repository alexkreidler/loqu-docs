title: Data Backends
---

We hope to offer the following backends;

- Hydra APIs
- SPARQL endpoints
- Embedded JSON-LD or Microdata from web pages (via `rdf-dereference`)

Each promotes unique interaction models, and thus has unique pages.

In fact, all of the above can be mixed, and we hope that users can use the application without necessarily thinking about the data sources behind it.
