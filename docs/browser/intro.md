The Loqu Browser is designed as a powerful interface to Semantic Web APIs and databases, that allows for quick and easy customization using Semantic Web components.

Its' goals are to:

- Provide a uniform interface for data-intensive applications
- Quickstart the development process by providing generic starter components
- Allow developers to create Semantic Web Components that can be filled with data from a variety of sources:
  - Hydra APIs
  - SPARQL endpoints
  - Embedded JSON-LD or Microdata from web pages

As a completely open source product, individuals or organizations may also fork the project if they want to make more substantial changes. Of course, we encourage sharing any changes that might be useful to the broader community via pull requests.
